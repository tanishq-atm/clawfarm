## Principles
- **Always verify and quick test** - Don't call things done without testing them first

## Leonardo.ai Automation Project ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Demo AgentMail + Browser Use for programmatic service access

**What we built:**
- Full end-to-end automation: inbox creation → signup → email verification → API key extraction → service usage
- Zero human intervention from start to finish

**Results:**
- Phase 1: Browser Use signed up account (leonardo-bot-20260204-034244@agentmail.to)
- Phase 2: Retrieved verification code `623535` from AgentMail API
- Phase 3: Browser Use entered code + extracted API key `5cd451b9-798a-472c-a66f-98aaf7cc4622`
- Validation: API key works, account has 150 tokens + 3344 API tokens
- Test: Generated AI image successfully using Leonardo API

**Lessons learned:**
- AgentMail SDK's `messages.get()` needed for full email content (list doesn't include body)
- Leonardo uses verification CODE not link (had to adapt Phase 3)
- Browser Use `create_task()` returns dict with `id` field, not just ID string
- Always test APIs immediately after getting keys (caught working config)

**Files created:**
- leonardo_automation_state.json (full execution log)
- leonardo_test_generation.json (image generation proof)
- phase3_verify_with_code.py (updated for code instead of link)
